                Bhive Visa's tax department incorporates a team of experts to

                We can help you minimise your tax liability, capitalise on tax
                deductions and manage your tax situation. With more experience
                than standard tax preparers, tax advisers can help with tax
                planning, inheritance issues, charitable donations, and other
                complex tax needs.

                We can also represent you before the tax authorities in
                Portugal. Tax representation is the link between a non-resident
                in Portugal and the Portuguese Tax Authority. In practical
                terms, a fiscal representative in Portugal acts on behalf of a
                non-resident in all fiscal and tax matters.
